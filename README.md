# OLRSC

## Project Description

### PURPOSE OF THE OLRSC
The Online Learning Readiness Self-Check (OLRSC) system is created to help you measure how ready you are for the online courses. Besides providing you an overall readiness score, we also provide individualized feedback and valuable resources for your success in online learning.

### ABOUT THE OLRSC
This OLRSC identifies your level of proficiency in the nine areas that significantly contribute to online academic success. It takes about 10 minutes to complete the self-check survey and the responses are anonymous. To provide you an accurate result, it is important that you choose the most honest description of yourself.
After you complete the survey, you will receive an overall score including individual scores in each area. All the recommendations and resources from proven research will be provided based on your strengths and weaknesses. Remember to keep a copy of the recommendations for your records and retake the survey later.

### WHO CAN USE THE OLRSC?
This system is for teacher candidates at TTU who want to diagnose their strengths and weaknesses in online learning.
